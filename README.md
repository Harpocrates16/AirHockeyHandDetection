# VirtualSliders - Air Hockey Using Hand Detection

## Project Overview

VirtualSliders is an innovative project that leverages computer vision techniques to revolutionize the gameplay experience of air hockey through real-time hand detection. Traditional air hockey requires a physical setup, limiting accessibility and social interaction. Our solution addresses these limitations by utilizing advanced hand detection algorithms to interpret playersâ€™ hand movements, enabling a fully digital and immersive experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Hand Detection**: Employs sophisticated computer vision algorithms to track and interpret players' hand movements, facilitating seamless gameplay without the need for physical equipment.
- **Gesture-Based Gameplay Mechanics**: Enhances player engagement through gesture-based interactions, including power-ups and additional scoring opportunities.
- **Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness**: Eliminates the need for physical infrastructure, making the game widely accessible and cost-effective.

## Therapeutic Applications

In addition to entertainment, VirtualSliders explores potential applications in **physiotherapy and rehabilitation**:

- **Low-Impact Physical Exercise**: Provides a fun and engaging method for patients to perform exercises that aid recovery from hand or arm injuries.
- **Enhanced Hand-Eye Coordination**: The interactive nature of the game assists in developing and improving motor skills.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time hand tracking capabilities allow for the effective monitoring of patient progress. The system's database stores game history and relevant statistics, offering valuable data for tracking rehabilitation outcomes.
