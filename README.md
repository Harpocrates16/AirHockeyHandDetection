# VirtualSliders - Air Hockey using Hand Detection
This project investigates the implementation of computer vision techniques to enhance the gameplay experience of air hockey through hand detection. Traditional air hockey
games require a physical table and equipment, limiting accessibility and socialization. To address this, we propose a computer vision-based solution utilizing real-time hand
detection algorithms to track and interpret players’ hand movements.

The proposed system empowers players to enjoy the game without the need for physical infrastructure, making it cost-effective and dynamic. Additionally, gesture-based gameplay mechanics, such as power-ups and additional scoring opportunities, are introduced
to enhance player immersion and interaction.

Moreover, this project explores the therapeutic potential of the hand detection-based virtual air hockey game, particularly in physiotherapy and rehabilitation settings. The
interactive nature of the game offers a low-impact form of physical exercise and improves hand-eye coordination, making it valuable for patients’ recovery. The real-time hand tracking capabilities enable progress monitoring, and the database system stores game
history and relevant statistics, providing valuable data for tracking patient improvement.

By combining entertainment with therapeutic benefits, this project contributes to computer vision advancements and medical rehabilitation practices, showcasing the potential
of leveraging real-time hand tracking to enhance traditional tabletop games.
This project is a combined effort done by Jonathan Antony, Joel Johnson, Krishnadas Balachandran and Joel Joseph Justin of class CSBeta Batch 2024, Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kakkanad.
